# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis 
###### The purpos of this analysis is to compare different ride sharing data between urban, suburban, and rural areas. 
## Results 
###### In the urban areas there are signifanctly more rides and total fares. However, compared to the other areas the cost per ride and fare per driver is signifcantly lower. 
## Summary 
###### Upon comparing the data I believe that the CEO should balance out the drivers between the areas. Although there are more rides in urban areas there are double the amount of drivers. That is making the fare per driver signifcantly lower. If there were less drivers in the area each driver would be paid a little bit more. In the rural area the fares are the highest per ride but they have the lowest amount of rides. I think the CEO should lower the cost of the rides and that could entice more people to use the ride sharing.
